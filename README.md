## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting extreme rainfall events (cloudbursts) using high-resolution NOAA weather data and machine learning. The report compiles work from across multiple assignments and milestones, including feature engineering, Random Forest modeling, SMOTE application, and ethical reflection, all tailored toward the real-world deployment of a cloudburst early warning system.
